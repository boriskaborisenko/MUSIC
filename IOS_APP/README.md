# IOS_APP (planned)

This folder is reserved for the native iOS client (`SwiftUI + AVPlayer`).

Planned next steps after backend MVP is verified:

1. Xcode project scaffold (`SwiftUI`, iOS 17+ target)
2. API client for this server (`/api/search`, `/api/albums`, `/api/playback/.../resolve`)
3. Playback engine (`AVPlayer`, background audio, lock screen controls)
4. Apple Music-like UI shell (tabs, search, library, now playing mini-player)
